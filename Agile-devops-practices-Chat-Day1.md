can u pls. explain cross-functional teams , i didn't got
From Me to Everyone:  10:36 AM
functional teams-->testing team, dev team, design team.. Tghesre are diff teams
Thses diff teams work in diff context, project,envronment,
Testing team can work on java app test, C++ app testing.
Thser is no sharing, or collaoboration..
functional teams--> in waterfall..Theya er executing tasks in sqeunec..\ Agiole suggests-->Cross Functional..
Team having diff skillsets in a group..
Dev and test team collaborates..
What is the adavanatge of this functional teams--> From Subhan Kamati to Everyone:  10:37 AM
the advantage is the development goes smoothly 
and there will be no delays in the delivery
i mean unnecessary delays 
yes
thanks i got it
From Me to Everyone:  10:39 AM
Appln delivry ,may not be compete at one stage..

facts overlooked by one coder can be corrected by another in Pair Programming.
From Subhan Kamati to Everyone:  11:07 AM
is restructuring the code is just to make it readable/user friendly ?
From Me to Everyone:  11:07 AM

From Malar to Everyone:  11:31 AM
ok
From Me to Everyone:  11:31 AM
DevOps can be completely agile
From Pradeep Repakula to Everyone:  11:31 AM
so there is no question of Devops without agile ?
From Me to Everyone:  11:32 AM
Can..Devops without agile ?
Collaboration in Devops itself is agiole
Agile -->Foundation for DevOPs..
From Subhan Kamati to Everyone:  11:32 AM
yes
From Pradeep Repakula to Everyone:  11:32 AM
ok
From Me to Everyone:  11:32 AM

Automatioon increass the frequency of delivery, comuincation, feedbacvk loops and everything..
From Subhan Kamati to Everyone:  11:54 AM
other than build and testing what all can be automated in DevOps?
From Me to Everyone:  11:58 AM
DevOps tools help in applying devOps culture, process and automation..
Deops process can adapt tools, people.
But culture of sharing and collaboation is manadatory. 
It comes with Devops agile mindset.
What is Configuration management tools
From Subhan Kamati to Everyone:  11:59 AM
managing the source code
maintenance 
From Malar to Everyone:  11:59 AM
managing the process of code delivery
From Me to Everyone:  12:03 PM

Thank you
From Me to Everyone:  12:10 PM
Dev in DevOps
Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
From Sumit Dasgupta to Everyone:  12:12 PM
code/delivery is validated faster
From Subhan Kamati to Everyone:  12:13 PM
with automated testing and feedback
as and when the coding is done
From Me to Everyone:  12:20 PM
Why Developer get confidence with Agile..?
Focus is on samall part
Why Smooth troubleshooting//?
Regorous amount of testing..
Post development, post deployment -->Testing
Java Enrmrnt-->Unit Testing -->Junit
testRunner-->To automate test execution
Diff in Unit and Integration Testing..?
From Sumit Dasgupta to Everyone:  12:20 PM
Integration testing involves multiple units and their interactions
From Subhan Kamati to Everyone:  12:20 PM
integration Testing - testing the code of multiple developers one merged
Unit Test - dev test  their individual codes
From Me to Everyone:  12:21 PM
Acceptable Testing-->Final testing
Unit Testing-->White Box Testing.
From Subhan Kamati to Everyone:  12:21 PM
code level testing 
From Malar to Everyone:  12:22 PM
we know th code and test
From Me to Everyone:  12:22 PM
Intergation testing-->Whitebox  ?
From Subhan Kamati to Everyone:  12:22 PM
integration testing is black box
From Malar to Everyone:  12:22 PM
blaxk box
black box
From Subhan Kamati to Everyone:  12:22 PM
blackbox
From Me to Everyone:  12:30 PM
Acceptance--Testing-->Balck box
Finished product testing only at end  : More severe bugs
Regorous and regression-->Unit Testing-->Reduces Bugs and Issues
Contunous Testing-->Is manadatory and Impportant Aspect of Development.
Should we test it one by one functions of the class after it
is written…
Delta in Requieremnets..? How much it matches the Requieremts and How much it is using..?
Some Code may not be called/use at all..
DEASD Code..
DEAD CODE..
Commnets,Sys Prints,Unused Classes and functions and variables..
How to ensure that the units follow the requirements
and nothing more and nothing less..?
From Subhan Kamati to Everyone:  12:30 PM
by following the coding standards
From Me to Everyone:  12:30 PM
Can testing ensure..?
From Subhan Kamati to Everyone:  12:31 PM
using code coverage
From Me to Everyone:  12:34 PM
Some code may not get tested..
May not gte used..
The Test case should match-->Requieremnt
THe impl code shoud match test case..
How to endsure that..
The Test case should match-->Requieremnt
THe impl code shoud match test case.. Test Case shoud DERIVE from Requieremets.
Unit Code shoud DERIVE from ..?
From Subhan Kamati to Everyone:  12:34 PM
from requirements
From Sumit Dasgupta to Everyone:  12:34 PM
design
From Me to Everyone:  12:35 PM
How it ensures that -->Code Matches the Requiermets..?
From Malar to Everyone:  12:36 PM
by testing the code 
From Me to Everyone:  12:37 PM
Code should DERIVE from Test Case..
Test Casse-->Requirent
Code-->Test Case
Code-->Matches Requierements.
The test ensures that the code mnathes the requirements.
matches..
From Malar to Everyone:  12:37 PM
yes
From Me to Everyone:  12:38 PM
What should be first written code or Test..?
From Subhan Kamati to Everyone:  12:38 PM
test
because we know the requirement
From Malar to Everyone:  12:38 PM
test and then code
From Me to Everyone:  12:43 PM
Traditinal-->Code-->Test
Requurents-->Test-->Code
Requurents-->Test-->Code-Test Requurents-->Test-->Code-->Test Test shoul be firts written
Test Driven Developemnt.
TDD
Test in absence of Code will FAIL..
From Malar to Everyone:  12:43 PM
so code should be wirttern before test ?
From Me to Everyone:  12:44 PM
NO code should be wirttern before test ..
From Malar to Everyone:  12:44 PM
ok
From Me to Everyone:  12:44 PM
Let the Test FAIL at first Attempt.
From Malar to Everyone:  12:44 PM
test write- > Let it fail -> then write code to pass ?
From Me to Everyone:  01:00 PM
Thet will identify wahy the test failed..?
Agile TDD  approach : test write- > Let it fail -> then write code to pass it and gain test it regorosuly. The code should be minimal required to make the test success and NOTHING extra and NOTHING Less.
This will avoid DEA=D code. 
Ensures that the code matches the -->Requieremts.
A good Test is small..it tests only small part..
It shoulkd run quickly
It should test ONLY ONe Part of Rewquueremts and NOT all or Multiple Reqs.
Evert test case shou NOT have depoenndency on oyjher test cases.
Every test case is self contained and isolated.
The test should be ideally small and testing
only one feature of the unit under test
TDD aproach-->implent a small case study for banking application.

From Me to Everyone:  11:03 AM
re-strucure the code..?
From Subhan Kamati to Everyone:  11:03 AM
if there is a show stopper or bug
From Sumit Dasgupta to Everyone:  11:04 AM
new/change functionality to be added based on feedback
From Me to Everyone:  11:06 AM
re-strucure the code for design, maintenance, readabiolity Testing is correct.After that we do re-strucure the code. Pair Programming..?
facts overlooked by one coder can be corrected by another in Pair Programming.
From Subhan Kamati to Everyone:  11:07 AM
is restructuring the code is just to make it readable/user friendly ?
From Me to Everyone:  11:07 AM
Pair Programming..?
facts overlooked by one coder can be corrected by another in Pair Programming. restructuring the code is just NOT to make it readable/user friendly ? From Subhan Kamati to Everyone:  11:07 AM
ok
From Subhan Kamati to Everyone:  11:13 AM
what is burndown charts
From Me to Everyone:  11:14 AM
Just a backlog of implementaions
From Subhan Kamati to Everyone:  11:14 AM
if we are developing a new product then where is the customer collaboration comes into picture

to release and change software.
focus is on whole software
development and delivery process and post
delivery operations as well
To improve quality and reduce the number of
incidents in production
Improves the overall efficiency in the process as
the team learns best practices
Where devops can be applied..?
From Malar to Everyone:  11:26 AM
deployment process 
testing process
From Subhan Kamati to Everyone:  11:27 AM
yes it can be development as well
From Me to Everyone:  11:27 AM
Can DevOPs be applied in waterfall model..?
From Subhan Kamati to Everyone:  11:27 AM
the requirement for dev/testing can be accomplished using dev ops
From Vishal Jain to Everyone:  11:27 AM
Nope
From Malar to Everyone:  11:28 AM
yes 
we can use it for code integration and testing
may not be used for deployment
From Me to Everyone:  11:30 AM
OPeration-->deploymnet, monitoring, feedabcak..
Devops in waterfall model has limited scope for collaboration.
Devops in Agile Software Mnagement
Devops and Agile work Hand in Hand..
Agile Practices nin DevOps
From Malar to Everyone:  11:31 AM
ok
From Me to Everyone:  11:31 AM
DevOps can be completely agile
From Pradeep Repakula to Everyone:  11:31 AM
so there is no question of Devops without agile ?
From Me to Everyone:  11:32 AM
Can..Devops without agile ?
Collaboration in Devops itself is agiole
Agile -->Foundation for DevOPs..
From Subhan Kamati to Everyone:  11:32 AM
yes
From Pradeep Repakula to Everyone:  11:32 AM
ok
From Me to Everyone:  11:32 AM
Let hjav small 10 mins brteak..

Automatioon increass the frequency of delivery, comuincation, feedbacvk loops and everything..
From Subhan Kamati to Everyone:  11:54 AM
other than build and testing what all can be automated in DevOps?
From Me to Everyone:  11:58 AM
DevOps tools help in applying devOps culture, process and automation..
Deops process can adapt tools, people.
But culture of sharing and collaboation is manadatory. 
It comes with Devops agile mindset.
What is Configuration management tools
From Subhan Kamati to Everyone:  11:59 AM
managing the source code

From Subhan Kamati to Everyone:  12:13 PM
with automated testing and feedback
as and when the coding is done
From Me to Everyone:  12:20 PM
Why Developer get confidence with Agile..?
Focus is on samall part
Why Smooth troubleshooting//?
Regorous amount of testing..
Post development, post deployment -->Testing
Java Enrmrnt-->Unit Testing -->Junit
testRunner-->To automate test execution
Diff in Unit and Integration Testing..?
From Sumit Dasgupta to Everyone:  12:20 PM
Integration testing involves multiple units and their interactions
From Subhan Kamati to Everyone:  12:20 PM
integration Testing - testing the code of multiple developers one merged
Unit Test - dev test  their individual codes
From Me to Everyone:  12:21 PM
Acceptable Testing-->Final testing
Unit Testing-->White Box Testing.
From Subhan Kamati to Everyone:  12:21 PM
code level testing 
From Malar to Everyone:  12:22 PM
we know th code and test
From Me to Everyone:  12:22 PM
Intergation testing-->Whitebox  ?
From Subhan Kamati to Everyone:  12:22 PM
integration testing is black box
From Malar to Everyone:  12:22 PM
blaxk box
black box
From Subhan Kamati to Everyone:  12:22 PM
blackbox
From Me to Everyone:  12:30 PM
Acceptance--Testing-->Balck box
Finished product testing only at end  : More severe bugs
Regorous and regression-->Unit Testing-->Reduces Bugs and Issues
Contunous Testing-->Is manadatory and Impportant Aspect of Development.
Should we test it one by one functions of the class after it
is written…
Delta in Requieremnets..? How much it matches the Requieremts and How much it is using..?
Some Code may not be called/use at all..
DEASD Code..
DEAD CODE..
Commnets,Sys Prints,Unused Classes and functions and variables..
How to ensure that the units follow the requirements
and nothing more and nothing less..?
From Subhan Kamati to Everyone:  12:30 PM
by following the coding standards
From Me to Everyone:  12:30 PM
Can testing ensure..?
From Subhan Kamati to Everyone:  12:31 PM
using code coverage
From Me to Everyone:  12:34 PM
Some code may not get tested..
May not gte used..
The Test case should match-->Requieremnt
THe impl code shoud match test case..
How to endsure that..
The Test case should match-->Requieremnt
THe impl code shoud match test case.. Test Case shoud DERIVE from Requieremets.
Unit Code shoud DERIVE from ..?
From Subhan Kamati to Everyone:  12:34 PM
from requirements
From Sumit Dasgupta to Everyone:  12:34 PM
design
From Me to Everyone:  12:35 PM
How it ensures that -->Code Matches the Requiermets..?
From Malar to Everyone:  12:36 PM
by testing the code 
From Me to Everyone:  12:37 PM
Code should DERIVE from Test Case..
Test Casse-->Requirent
Code-->Test Case
Code-->Matches Requierements.
The test ensures that the code mnathes the requirements.
matches..
From Malar to Everyone:  12:37 PM
yes
From Me to Everyone:  12:38 PM
What should be first written code or Test..?
From Subhan Kamati to Everyone:  12:38 PM
test
because we know the requirement
From Malar to Everyone:  12:38 PM
test and then code
From Me to Everyone:  12:43 PM
Traditinal-->Code-->Test
Requurents-->Test-->Code
Requurents-->Test-->Code-Test Requurents-->Test-->Code-->Test Test shoul be firts written
Test Driven Developemnt.
TDD
Test in absence of Code will FAIL..
From Malar to Everyone:  12:43 PM
so code should be wirttern before test ?
From Me to Everyone:  12:44 PM
NO code should be wirttern before test ..
From Malar to Everyone:  12:44 PM
ok
From Me to Everyone:  12:44 PM
Let the Test FAIL at first Attempt.
From Malar to Everyone:  12:44 PM
test write- > Let it fail -> then write code to pass ?
From Me to Everyone:  01:00 PM
Thet will identify wahy the test failed..?
Agile TDD  approach : test write- > Let it fail -> then write code to pass it and gain test it regorosuly. The code should be minimal required to make the test success and NOTHING extra and NOTHING Less.
This will avoid DEA=D code. 
Ensures that the code matches the -->Requieremts.
A good Test is small..it tests only small part..
It shoulkd run quickly
It should test ONLY ONe Part of Rewquueremts and NOT all or Multiple Reqs.
Evert test case shou NOT have depoenndency on oyjher test cases.
Every test case is self contained and isolated.
The test should be ideally small and testing
only one feature of the unit under test
TDD aproach-->implent a small case study for banking application.

From Malar to Everyone:  01:00 PM
ok
From Me to Everyone:  01:00 PM
Lets have Lunch Break..
We will contiue by 2.00pm..
From Malar to Everyone:  01:01 PM
thank you
From Pradeep Repakula to Everyone:  01:01 PM
ok Thankyou
From Me to Everyone:  01:59 PM
Shall we continue..
From Anand Sonigra to Everyone:  01:59 PM
yes
From Me to Everyone:  02:00 PM
You can follow me by actions..
From Subhan Kamati to Everyone:  02:03 PM
i am not getting the flow
From Me to Everyone:  02:08 PM
Started Eclipse-->New Worksapce
Create New Java project
Banking-SavingAccount
We will have to write test first..
Which Test first we should write..?
The test should be mimum testing of account without any dependencies..
Test firt for availavility of SavingAccount..
Test class with test method..
From Pradeep Repakula to Everyone:  02:08 PM
ok
From Me to Subhan Kamati:  (Privately) 02:09 PM
Are you following now..?
From Me to Everyone:  02:21 PM
Create New Test class TestSavingAccount in package test.com.bank..
Create  first test case for availavility of SavingAccount..
Test class with test method.. Set the Junit as test library to execute the test cases..
Junit version 4 from Eclipse path
The @Test marks the method as test method in Junit..
We have to crreate a new class SavingAccount..
Beacuse the test needs..
SavingAccount class in app.com.bank package
From Me to Everyone:  02:31 PM
New Test case-->Faile at firts time..
Justification for Code that You are writing..
SavingAccount obj = new SavingAccount();
	
From Sumit Dasgupta to Everyone:  02:32 PM
In case of TDD who is responsible to write the Test... Tester or developer
From Me to Everyone:  02:34 PM
Test is unit test..White Box test
Test Writer should able to understand the code implemention
developer shd write unit test case. Every test shopuld be written and tested as one at a time..
From Me to Everyone:  02:39 PM
Wjhat is next test case..?
From Malar to Everyone:  02:39 PM
check for balance
From Me to Everyone:  02:40 PM
either deposit or check balance..
From Me to Everyone:  02:53 PM
Two test cases written and successfully executed with code implmnetion
We vare evolving the code as per the requtremetrs-test cases.
In TDD.. Accomodation of change is NOT thet diffiucult..
Much more test code than app code.
This MVP..
From Pradeep Repakula to Everyone:  02:53 PM
yes
From Sumit Dasgupta to Everyone:  03:13 PM
In actual project scenario, do we get use //Fake statements, in case the functionalities is part of a subsequent iteration...
From Me to Everyone:  03:13 PM
any queries..
Yes..
From Sumit Dasgupta to Everyone:  03:13 PM
ok
From Me to Everyone:  03:17 PM
Fake statements  bshoueNOT be peram,enet. When nthe reafctoring shoud be done..?
From Subhan Kamati to Me:  (Privately) 03:17 PM
when the test cases are ready
From Me to Everyone:  03:18 PM

From Me to Everyone:  03:18 PM
After suvcesful execution of test cases..
From Subhan Kamati to Everyone:  03:19 PM
yes
From Me to Everyone:  03:19 PM
Should we test after refactoring..?
Alwats..
always..
From Malar to Everyone:  03:19 PM
yes
From Me to Everyone:  03:20 PM
Shoukld we refactor the test code..?
From Subhan Kamati to Everyone:  03:20 PM
no i suppose
From Me to Everyone:  03:26 PM
If the requiremets change..test cases hsould also chnage ..might reqyiure refactoring 
Sometimes app code is reactored with different features..
RED-->GREEN-->Refatctoring..
Refatctoring shoyukd alos consider design issues.. Refactoring satge-->Certain design petterns can be applied..  After every rrefactoringb tests should NEVER faile..
RED-->Green-->Refactror-->GREEN
D:\Agile-DevOps-Training\Projects\TDD-Projects\BankAccounts-SavingAccount is the implmeentaion for this bank case study..
Once we undestand the requirements-->Should we write all the test cases..
at one go
From Malar to Everyone:  03:27 PM
only those needed for the sprint or module
From Me to Everyone:  03:28 PM
Should we execute all the test cases at one go..

TDD is meant for unit testing
Acceptance Tests  done in TDD manner..
Cuuember with JUnit run as TDD and Develop appln with Acceptance Test cases
This ATDD
Development with TDD is slower..?
Not really..
Consider code first without test..Develop and test ait you get stuck up..
TDD is much better than Code first approach..
TDD is with samall steps..
But when you know the implsmentions and you are confident..you canntke a big jump in coding also..
Example where you take small steps in TDD and bigger steps in TDD..?
From Sumit Dasgupta to Everyone:  04:05 PM
Maybe where req. is clear... we can take bigger steps
From Me to Everyone:  04:06 PM
 Implmnet Mah sum method..
You can consider negative value,zero and summation at the same time
From Malar to Everyone:  04:08 PM
what is green bar
success ?
From Me to Everyone:  04:08 PM
Correct
From Malar to Everyone:  04:09 PM
but tin that picture it means success of the sprint ?
ok
From Me to Everyone:  04:16 PM
Indirectly with TDD we get the qulaity imprivement..
We focus on small atsk asw ell as quality
Legacy with nTDD
TDD
Ols systems may not hyave unit/acceptance tst cases
OLd systems
You need to genearte/write test cases
Study the entire system.
TDD with Legacy Systems
Once code is rready with test cases..
think about reafctoring
How to ensure that changing its external
behavior.,.. Extrenal behvr is not chnaged..
How to Measure the success of reactoring..
From Sumit Dasgupta to Everyone:  04:17 PM
test cases should remain green
