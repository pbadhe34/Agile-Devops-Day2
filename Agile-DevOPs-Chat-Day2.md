Working code-->matching requrements
It may have bad quality..
From Subhan Kamati to Everyone:  10:13 AM
stability
with testing
From Me to Everyone:  10:14 AM
stability-->Reliability with testing.. Performance-->comes later in Production..Tuning
Performance is -->One parameter From Sumit Dasgupta to Everyone:  10:14 AM
readability, maintenance, less or no dead code, 
From Me to Everyone:  10:18 AM
Hown the code is readable to thid person and underastandable
Code Coverage-->Code covered or used during testing..
Test Coverage..
What about Test Coverage.? From Sumit Dasgupta to Everyone:  10:18 AM
testing all req
From Dayanand Palamkar (DP) to Everyone:  10:18 AM

pls. go back to earlier slide
here how does the size of deployment part of coding guidelines
From Me to Everyone:  10:28 AM
One Web deplpoyment size was 445MB War file.
After reducinmg the size-->it got working afster.
From Subhan Kamati to Everyone:  10:29 AM
how do we define the size? is it based on some calculations
From Me to Everyone:  10:31 AM
Upto the organizations-->restricvt the size of deployment units and artifacts.
Based on performance and deplyment, sharing considereations..we define size..
From Subhan Kamati to Everyone:  10:31 AM
so can i define the size of deployment of 100 MB? how do i get this number 100?  is it decided post testing the performance
From Me to Everyone:  10:31 AM
Majprly on decided post testing the performance From Subhan Kamati to Everyone:  10:32 AM
then it is based on testing and not part of coding guidelines right
From Me to Everyone:  10:33 AM
deployment gudelines..
During build stage-->
From Subhan Kamati to Everyone:  10:33 AM
no, how can we consider in advance
From Me to Everyone:  10:33 AM
